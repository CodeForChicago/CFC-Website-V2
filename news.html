        <p class= "content"> 
            This year, CFC has been invited to partake in <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/meetings/cgi-university/2016" target="_blank">Clinton Global Initiative University </a> (CGIU). CGIU is a networking event hosted by the <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/" target="_blank"> Clinton Foundation</a> and the Clinton Family. They bring in university students from all over the world that have a project for the betterment of the world in hopes that this event can help the students realize the project. There, the students can connect with other students, go to seminars on running a not-for-profit organization and have a chance to earn some money. As such, CGIU is an awesome opportunity for CFC!

            CGIU was actually the catalyst for Code For Chicago. In <a href="http://isen.northwestern.edu/news_media/articles/2014/12/30dec2014_cgiuannouncement.html" target="_blank">March 2015</a>, Juan David Dominguez, Martha Cecilia Curi and Eugene Park took an idea of teaching students critical thinking and creativity through code to CGIU UMiami. They came back to Northwestern empowered, enlightened and determined to carry out their idea. Thus, CFC was born.

        <p class= "content"> 
            Now, Upasna Madhok, Akshay Batra and Wajihuddin Mohammed Omar were invited to UCBerekeley for their own novel idea, affiliated with CFC. The proposal is to have local software engineers and businesses host demonstrations and panels, through CFC, so that the students can have an opportunity to see how their newfound skills can impact the world.

        <p class= "content"> 
            We wish them the best of luck and are incredibly proud to have them represent CFC.
